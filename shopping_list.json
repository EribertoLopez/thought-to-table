But topped like a loaded baked potato? Exponentially better. Incorporating some of the bacon fat into the cream mixture introduces a welcome thread of smokiness through the whole dish. To get ahead of dinner prep, you can crisp the bacon, slice the scallions, and make the cream base a few hours or even a day ahead, but peel and slice the potatoes just before assembling. Slicing ahead of time requires holding the potatoes in water to prevent oxidation, which will cause your filling to be soupy and thin no matter how well you think you\u2019ve blotted the slices dry.All products featured on Bon App\u00e9tit are independently selected by our editors.

Diamond Crystal or 1 Tbsp. Morton kosher salt2tsp. freshly ground pepper5lb. russet potatoes (about 10 large)3oz. sharp yellow cheddar, coarsely grated (about 1 cup)\u2153cup sour cream4scallions, dark green parts only, thinly sliced on a diagonalSpecial EquipmentA mandolinePreparationStep 1Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375\u00b0. Cook 12 oz. bacon (about 12 slices), cut into \u00bc\" pieces, in a medium skillet over medium heat, stirring often, until brown and crisp, 6\u20138 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels to drain.Step 2Spoon 3 Tbsp. bacon fat into a medium saucepan; discard or reserve remaining fat for another use. Add 6 garlic cloves, finely grated, 3 cups heavy cream, 1 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 Tbsp. Morton kosher salt, and 2 tsp. freshly ground pepper, set over medium heat, and cook, stirring occasionally, just until salt is dissolved, about 1 minute (it doesn\u2019t need to be hot). Remove from heat.Step 3Peel 5 lb. russet potatoes (about 10 large) and, using mandoline, slice into about \u00b9\u2044\u2081\u2086\"-thick rounds. Pour a third of the cream mixture into a 13x9\" baking dish. Arrange potato slices in dish, fanning out a handful at a time so they overlap slightly and pressing down gently in between additions to compress, until all potatoes have been used and bottom of dish is covered. Pour remaining cream mixture over; press down on potatoes so they\u2019re mostly submerged. Cover dish tightly with foil; bake until potatoes are tender, 60\u201370 minutes (a tester inserted in the middle should meet with barely any resistance). Remove foil, scatter 3 oz. sharp yellow cheddar, coarsely grated (about 1 cup), over, and continue to bake, uncovered, until cheese is melted, 6\u20138 minutes more.Step 4Let scalloped potatoes cool 5 minutes, then top with small dollops of \u2153 cup sour cream and scatter 4 scallions, dark green parts only, thinly sliced on a diagonal, and bacon over.Do Ahead: Scalloped potatoes (without cheese and toppings) can be made 1 day ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Reheat, covered, in a 350\u00b0 oven 20 minutes, then uncover, top with cheese, and cook until melted, 7\u20139 minutes.Explore Bon App\u00e9titSideDinnerNut-FreeGluten-FreeMake AheadOven BakeThanksgivingBaconCured MeatMeatRusset PotatoPotatoVegetableCheddarCheeseRecipe notesBack to TopTriangleJoin the home cook communitySign in or create accountMore from BArecipesBA\u2019s Best Eggplant ParmesanBy Claire SaffitzrecipesUltimate Vegan RamenBy Sonoko SakairecipesKorean Potato SaladBy Shilpa UskokovicrecipesBA\u2019s Best LasagnaBy Chris MoroccorecipesGreen Curry Chicken Pot PieBy Shilpa UskokovicrecipesSpiced Double Potato NoodlesBy Hetty Lui McKinnonrecipesMashed Baked PotatoesBy Claire SaffitzrecipesJapanese CheesecakeBy Mieko TakahashiRecipes you want to make.
